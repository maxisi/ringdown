ringdown
========

**ringdown** is a Python package for the Bayesian analysis of black hole ringdowns in data from gravitational-wave detectors, like `LIGO <https://www.ligo.caltech.edu>`_ and `Virgo <https://www.virgo-gw.eu>`_.

`ringdown` contains basic utilities to manipulate strain data and easily set up your own inference analyses quickly. The current implementation relies on `PyMC <https://docs.pymc.io/>`_ for sampling multidimensional posterior probability densities.

This documentation is being actively developed. Usage examples can be found :doc:`here <gallery>` and API documentation in the :ref:`modindex`.

Example
-------

You can get an analysis going with just a few lines of code. For example, assuming you have already downloaded GW150914 data from `GWOSC <https://www.gw-openscience.org>`_::

    import ringdown as rd
    fit = rd.Fit('mchi', modes=[(1,-2,2,2,0), (1,-2,2,2,1)])
    fit.load_data('{i}-{i}1_GWOSC_16KHZ_R1-1126259447-32.hdf5', ifos=['H1', 'L1'], kind='gwosc')
    fit.set_target(1126259462.4083147, ra=1.95, dec=-1.27, psi=0.82, duration=0.05)
    fit.condition_data(ds=8)
    fit.update_prior(A_scale=1e-21, M_min=50, M_max=150)
    fit.run()

Or run using a configuration file from the :doc:`command line <exe_ringdown_fit>`:

.. code-block:: console

    ringdown_fit config.ini

See full-fledged examples in the :doc:`gallery`.
