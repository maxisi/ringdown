; INSTRUCTIONS TO LOAD BASELINE STRAIN DATA
; `path` can be a string with replacement tokens '{i}' and '{ifo}' to be
; replaced by detector initial and key (e.g., 'H' and 'H1' respectively for
; LIGO Hanford) or a dictionary with IFOs as keys and paths as entries; in the
; former case, the `ifo` option is required to list the detectors to be
; analyzed.  Additional options will be passed to `ringdown.Data.read`

; if `path` option included, same format as for [data] will be assumed and all

; option is required). Note that the path can point to a PSD, if the `from_psd
; = True` option is provided.  Alternatively, if `path` is omitted, options in
; this section will be passed to the ACF constructur
; `ringdown.Fit.compute_acfs`.
